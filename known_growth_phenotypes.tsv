Glucose	cpd00027	Y	
Acetate	cpd00029	Y	
Glycolate	cpd00139	N	
Homarine	cpd00737	U	Not sure about metabolite ID. Called gynesine in ModelSEED.
3-hydroxybutyrate	cpd29193	Y	
Choline	cpd00098	N	
Ectoine	cpd03727	N	
Alanine	cpd00035	U	Maybe. Only grows on first transfer from rich media but not subsequent; maybe using storage. Used the ModelSEED ID for L-alanine.
Proline	cpd00129	U	"Maybe. Took over a week for noticeable, but weak, growth; usually takes less than 12 h on glucose. Used the ModelSEED ID for L-proline."
