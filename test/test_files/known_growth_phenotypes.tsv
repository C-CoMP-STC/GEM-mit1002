ZAC	Glucose 	cpd00027	Yes	
L1	Glucose 	cpd00027	Yes	
ZAC	Acetate	cpd00029	Yes	
L1	Acetate	cpd00029	Yes	
ZAC	Glycolate	cpd00139	No	
ZAC	Homarine	cpd00737	Unsure	Not sure about metabolite ID. Called gynesine in ModelSEED.
ZAC	3-hydroxybutyrate	cpd29193	Yes	
ZAC	Choline	cpd00098	No	
ZAC	Ectoine	cpd03727	No	
ZAC	Alanine	cpd00035	Unsure	Maybe. Only grows on first transfer from rich media but not subsequent; maybe using storage. Used the ModelSEED ID for L-alanine.
L1	Alanine	cpd00035	Yes	
ZAC	Proline	cpd00129	Unsure	"Maybe. Took over a week for noticeable, but weak, growth; usually takes less than 12 h on glucose. Used the ModelSEED ID for L-proline."
L1	Proline	cpd00129	Yes

ZAC	Fructose	cpd00082	No	
L1	Glycerol-3-phosphate	cpd00080	Yes	
L1	DHPS (dihydroxypropanesulfonate)	cpd23538	Yes	
L1	Tyrosine	cpd00069	Yes	Assumed we wanted L-tyrosine.
L1	Glutamate	cpd00023	Yes	Assumed we wanted L-glutamate.
L1	Valine	cpd00156	Yes	Assumed we wanted L-valine.
