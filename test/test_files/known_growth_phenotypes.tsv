l1	Acetate	cpd00029	Yes	
mbm	Glycolate	cpd00139	No	
mbm	Homarine	cpd00737	Unsure	Not sure about metabolite ID. Called gynesine in ModelSEED.
mbm	3-hydroxybutyrate	cpd29193	Yes	
mbm	Choline	cpd00098	No	
mbm	Ectoine	cpd03727	No	
mbm	Alanine	cpd00035	Unsure	Maybe. Only grows on first transfer from rich media but not subsequent; maybe using storage. Used the ModelSEED ID for L-alanine.
l1	Alanine	cpd00035	Yes	
mbm	Proline	cpd00129	Unsure	"Maybe. Took over a week for noticeable, but weak, growth; usually takes less than 12 h on glucose. Used the ModelSEED ID for L-proline."

l1	DHPS (dihydroxypropanesulfonate)	cpd23538	Yes	
l1	Tyrosine	cpd00069	Yes	Assumed we wanted L-tyrosine.
l1	Glutamate	cpd00023	Yes	Assumed we wanted L-glutamate.
